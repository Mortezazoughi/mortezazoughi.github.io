            <p> I was born in Tehran and migrated to US in early 1980s. In addition to academics, I participated in
                organized
                sports. I have been playing soccer since I was about 5 years old. In 1980s I attended a junior college
                prior
                to
                attending the university for degree program. As a member of the International Student Club, I and two
                other
                students, were
                able to obtain permission from the state and the president of the college to start a soccer team.
                Although
                we were not able
                to win any championship during my participation, we were able to participate in tournaments which
                allowed
                few
                players to join major university's soccer teams and compete in NCAA games. After completing my degree, I
                obtained a real estate and insurance license in the state of Georgia and have been practicing real
                estate
                since 1995.
