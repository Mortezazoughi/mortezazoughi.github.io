      <pre>                       I have always loved animals. Unlike humans, animals are simple  
                  and have no hidden agendas. They are forgiving and teach us a lot. I have always 
                  had a special love for cats. I believe that cats are cool. Here are 8 reasons why 
                  cats are the coolest:

             
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >1) They are very independant:</span>           
                  They can always stay by themselves and do need to be entertained.
                  They will be fine if you need to leave for a few days. All you have to make sure is
                  that they have enough food and water.
            
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >2) They can use the bathroom:</span>            
                  All cats need a litter box. Although youmay find litter boxes gross,
                  they are much better than having to clean after a dog going to bathroom all over the house.
                  You can even teach a cat to use the real toilet.

           
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >3) They don't need to be walked</span>           
                  Cats needs are: food, sleep and hanging out.
                  They don't need to be walked during the day while tyou are at work nor
                  do you need to walk them before bedtime.
           
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >4) They are good with kids</span>            
                  Cats are usually great with kids. You never hear about any cat that
                  injured or killed kids.
            
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >5) They are quiet </span>            
                  Cats compared to dogs are pretty quiet. They do not
                  bark at the passing cars. You will not hear cats barking in the
                  middle of the night waking the whole house up.
                  Cats also will never be loud or jump on your visitors. 
                              
           
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >6) They are clean</span>            
                  Cats never smell like dogs.  They bathe themselve everyday
                  while dogs sweat become smelly while cats constantly make 
                  sure that they are clean.
            
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic";>7) They will be content to be inside all their life</span>
           
                  Cats can live indoors all their lives and be happy.  THey will not 
                  bring in any fleas or thicks.  

            
                  <span style= "font-weight:900; font-size: 22px; font-style: italic"; >8) They are natural hunters</span>            
                  Having cats around will help you control the population
                  of insects and you will never have any rodent problems in your house.
